## Introduction

- This projects aims to showcases the different aspect of used cars market through analysis using Python.

## Web Scraping

The web scraping phase of this project was implemented using Python and the Beautiful Soup library. This process involved extracting data from the AutoMobile.tn website to collect information related to cars Brand, Type , Manufacture_year, Mileage , Price , Body_type , Fuel ,   Horse_Power , Gear_box , Transmission , Color , Governorate , Address .

**Key Steps:**

- Used the requests library to send HTTP requests to the AutoMobile.tn website.
- Iterated through multiple web pages to gather a list of individual announcement then i iterated through these announcement  .
- Employed Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of the web pages and extract specific data elements, such as  Brand, Type , Manufacture_year, Mileage , Price , Body_type , Fuel ,   Horse_Power , Gear_box , Transmission , Color , Governorate , Address .

**Challenges:**

- The website structure was hard to deal with and to parse through .

## Data Cleaning

- Cleaning the data was about eleminating doubles, changing columns data types and preparing the data for visualization for that i used Pandas and Geopandas  .

## Data Visualization

- The data Visualization part i used Matplotlib Library to create histogram bars and to show case geospatial files.
